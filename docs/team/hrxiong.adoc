== PROJECT: TutorPal

---

== Overview

TutorPal is a desktop application used by private home tutors for managing student information. The useage is primarily through CLI. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *add and edit grades feature*
** What it does: Allows tutors to add one or more than one grade records for a student during using editing command or adding a student with the help of add command.
** Justification: As an indicator of the quality of teaching,grades are a very important part of tutoring.
If the exam results can be recorded, the tutor can more easily analyze the student's learning status and reflect his or her own teaching ability as well.


* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *delete grades feature*
** What is does: Allow tutors to delete a grade record of a students stored in TutorPal.
** Justification: Tutor can also use the undo command to delete the wrong records inputted. And this way is more efficient way if the tutor
is good at typing. But if the tutor inputs a wrong name of the exam and then closes the TutorPal unfortunately, the undo command will out of action.
So a deleteGrade command is added to fix this logic bug.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Configuring Travis, Coverage and auto-publishing of documentation.
*** Setting up and assigning of the issue tracker.
*** Editing project Milestone.
